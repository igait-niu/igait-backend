                <h2>NOTICE OF PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

                <p><strong>Protecting Your Personal and Health Information</strong></p>
                <p>Northern Illinois University and XXXXXXXXXXXX are committed to protecting the privacy of patient personal and health information. Applicable Federal and State laws require us to maintain the privacy of our XXXXXX personal and health information. This Notice explains our privacy practices, our legal duties, and your rights concerning your personal and health information. In this Notice, your personal or protected health information (PHI) is referred to as “health information” and includes information regarding your health care and treatment with identifiable factors such as your name, age, address, income, or other financial information. We will follow the privacy practices described in this Notice while it is in effect. This Notice takes effect XXXXXX and will remain in effect until replaced.</p>

                <p><strong>How We Protect Your Health Information</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Treating all of your health information that we collect as confidential.</li>
                    <li>Stating confidentiality policies and practices in our policies, as well as disciplinary measures for privacy violations.</li>
                    <li>Restricting access to your health information only to those who need to know your health information in order to XXXXXXXXXXXXX.</li>
                    <li>Only disclosing your health information that is necessary for XXXXX and all those receiving information have by contract agreed to protect and maintain the confidentiality of your health information.</li>
                    <li>Maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to comply with federal and state regulations guarding your health information.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations</strong></p>
                <p>The XXXXXXXXXXXX may use or disclose your protected health information (PHI), for XXXXXXXXX. To help clarify these terms, here are some definitions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use</strong> applies only to activities within our organization such as sharing, employing, applying, utilizing, examining, and analyzing information that identifies you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disclosure</strong> applies to activities outside of our organization, such as releasing, transferring, or providing access to information about you to other parties.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Uses and Disclosures Requiring Authorization</strong></p>
                <p>The XXXXXXXXX may use or disclose PHI for purposes outside treatment, payment, or healthcare operations when your appropriate authorization is obtained. An “authorization” is written permission beyond the general consent that permits only specific disclosures. In those instances when we are asked for information for purposes outside of treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, we will obtain an authorization from you before releasing this information.</p>
                <p>You may revoke all such authorizations at any time, provided each revocation is in writing. You may not revoke an authorization to the extent that (1) we relied on that authorization; or (2) if the authorization was obtained as a condition of obtaining insurance coverage, law provides the insurer the right to contest the claim under the policy.</p>

                <p><strong>Limits of Confidentiality</strong></p>
                <p>XXXXXXXXXXXX.</p>
                <p>In addition, personnel may be mandated reporters; therefore, confidentiality must be waived under the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the staff believes that a client is at risk of harming himself/herself or anyone else.</li>
                    <li>If the staff believes that a child is at risk of being neglected or abused.</li>
                    <li>If the staff believes that an elder or disabled adult is being neglected, abused, or financially exploited.</li>
                    <li>If there is a court order for release of information.</li>
                    <li>If the client is a minor (under 12 years of age), the client does not have a legal right to keep therapy or assessment information confidential from his/her parent(s) or guardian(s). If the client is a minor 12-17 years of age, the parent/guardian may request and receive only basic information, e.g., current physical and mental condition or diagnosis, unless the child gives consent. (For purposes of therapy, however, the parent/guardian may agree to grant the minor privacy in therapy.)</li>
                    <li>In accordance with Public Act 099-0278, if you are a current student enrolled at Northern Illinois University, you have been given the opportunity to declare a mental health emergency contact person. If a client threatens to do harm to himself, herself, or others, the psychologist has a duty to contact the person designated as a mental health emergency contact.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on the IL Firearm Concealed Carry Law (FOID; Public Act 098-0063), clients who are determined to be a clear and present danger to themselves and/or their community, or who are determined to be developmentally or intellectually disabled, must be reported to the IL Department of Human Services FOID Mental Health Reporting System within 24 hours of determination.</p>

                <p><strong>Rights and Duties</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rights to Request Restrictions</strong> – You have the right to request additional restrictions on certain uses and disclosures of protected health information. We may not be able to accept your request, but if we do, we will uphold the restriction unless it is an emergency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Receive Confidential Communications by Alternative Means and at Alternative Locations</strong> – You have the right to request and receive confidential communications of PHI by alternative means and at alternative locations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Inspect and Copy</strong> – You have the right to inspect or obtain a copy (or both) of your health records. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying or, if necessary, redacting the record. Access to your records may be limited or denied under certain circumstances, but in most cases, you have a right to request a review of that decision. At your request, we will discuss with you the details of the request and denial process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Amend</strong> - You have the right to request in writing an amendment of your health information for as long as PHI records are maintained. The request must identify which information is incorrect and include an explanation of why you think it should be amended. If the request is denied, a written explanation stating why will be provided to you. You may also make a statement disagreeing with the denial which will be added to the information of the original request. If your original request is approved, we will make a reasonable effort to include the amended information in future disclosures. Amending a record does not mean that any portion of your health information will be deleted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to an Accounting</strong> – You generally have the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of PHI. If your health information is disclosed for any reason other than treatment, program evaluation, payment, or operation, you have the right to an accounting of each disclosure for the previous six (6) years. The accounting will include the date, name of person or entity, description of the information disclosed, the reason for disclosure, and other applicable information. If more than one (1) accounting is requested in a twelve (12) month period, a reasonable fee may be charged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electronic vs. Paper Copy</strong> – If you receive this notice electronically (e.g., accessing a website), you have the right to obtain a paper copy of the notice from the PSC upon request.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Our Duties:</strong></p>
                <p>We are required by law to maintain the privacy of PHI and to provide you with a notice of legal duties and privacy practices. Northern Illinois University reserves the right to change the privacy policies and practices described in this notice. Unless we notify you of such changes, however, we are required to abide by the terms currently in effect.</p>

                <p><strong>Changes to this Notice</strong></p>
                <p>The University reserves the right to change our privacy practices and terms of this Notice at any time, as permitted by applicable law. We reserve the right to make the changes in our privacy practices and the new terms of our Notice effective for all health information that we maintain, including health information we created or received before we made the changes. You may request a copy of the Notice at any time.</p>

                <p><strong>Questions and Complaints</strong></p>
                <p>For questions regarding this Notice or our privacy practices, please contact XXXXXXXX or the University Privacy Officer.</p>
                <p>If you are concerned that your privacy rights may have been violated, you may contact the University Privacy Officer to make a complaint. You may also make a written complaint to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services whose address can be provided upon request.</p>
                
                <p>If you choose to make a complaint with us or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we will not retaliate in any way. </p>
